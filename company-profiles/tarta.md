[Tarta.ai](https://tarta.ai/) is a bot that helps you find work. The bot monitors vacancies and selects the best. 

After that, he organizes an interview and even helps to get an interview.
Our big goal is to replace job sites with a personal AI assistant that will allow you to find a good job faster and without stress.

For employers, this is an opportunity to offer a vacancy to candidates who are in active job search. Those who are suitable for hard and soft skills.
Today Tarta takes on several ‚Äúduties‚Äù of a recruiter at once: sourcing, data enrichment, screening and arranging interviews.

A little more detail how this works:

#### Sourcing / research
The bot has a large audience of active candidates. Plus, every day we get candidates through advertising, organic traffic at https://tarta.ai/, referrals and word of mouth.
Companies no longer need to look for candidates themselves and think about how to contact them. Tarta bot ‚Äúoffers‚Äù vacancy to candidates through several communication channels at once: Facebook Messenger, Email and SMS. The candidate will definitely not miss a jobüòä.

#### Data enrichment
Tarta knows a lot about candidates, maybe even a lot üòé. For example, name and surname, contact information (email, phone and profile link in fb), city, time zone, language, photo, salary expectations, experience, technical stack.
The bot receives information directly from candidates through a series of chat questions. Some information from sources such as social. network and resume.
Recruiters no longer need to spend hours and manually ‚Äúdig‚Äù all this information. Information is available to recruiters anonymously. After the candidate agrees to a warm introduction, Tarta opens the name, contact details and photo.

#### Screening
The bot automatically checks whether the candidate is suitable for the vacancy. Only a small percentage of candidates who meet the requirements of the vacancy and company profile will receive an offer and will be invited to an interview.
Interview organization

Everything is simple here, after the candidate agrees to the interview, the bot offers the candidates to choose the appropriate time for a call or on-site meeting. Before this, the recruiter connects his Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook calendar, in which the bot creates an event. 

How much time do you spend on ping-pong emails when scheduling calls and meeting candidates? Most likely a lot. You can also forget about it.
